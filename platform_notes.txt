1. Before starting using any Python module what will be the first step? dir(platform) or help(platform)
2. uname --> Returns OS (Operating System) info.  uname -a,  uname -r, uname -m
3. Three (3) principles must be followed in the coding. 
    3.1 --> Reusibility
    3.2 --> Readibility
    3.3 --> Modularity 

Anil asks: Can WE import multiple modules at the same time? Yes you can. Including through terminal or IDE (VSCode, Pycharm)


Apache access logs with Python 

1. Once SSH into the instance to find out the OS --> cat /etc/*-release or cat /etc/os-release
2.  cat /etc/passwd --> Returns all users present in the instance
3. systemctl status httpd --> To check if apache is active or not 
4. systemctl start httpd
5. cd /var/www/html 
6. vim index.html --> <h1> Orchsky school </h1>  and esc and wq 
7. cd cd /var/log/httpd/ and open access_log file 

We need to achieve 3 important tasks. 
=====================================
Requirements
1. We need to determine from where people accessing the website 
2. Count number of times IP repeated 
3. Need to save output in CSV file 
4. Build user frindly code which works in all circumstances. 
=====================================
4. RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.
5. Tuple --> 
Tuple. Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple is one of 4 built-in data 
types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, 
all with different qualities and usage. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
6. Linting -->  static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic and suspicous 
constracts. For python --> flake8, CloudFormation --> cfn-lint 
7. Python formatter --> Black
